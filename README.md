# Spectrophotometer for Analyzing Liquid Samples (SALS)
Spring 2020, Final Project for ISCI-496 Interactive Device Design (American University)

Lily Donaldson, Ã‰owyn Fain, Cheldina Jean, Fiona Murphey

## Description
This is a device proposal for a spectrophotometer to analyze liquid samples. 

* This device shall analyze a liquid's chemical composition based on its spectral distribution by comparing its spectral data to a pre-defined or user-defined database of liquid spectral readings and returning a 'percent likeness' to these database spectra.
* This device shall allow for the creation of a user-defined database of liquid spectral readings
* This device may also be used to analyze a liquid's turbidity and/or potability.

This device is based off of archived designs from the "Safety Spectrometer" tutuorial formerly hosted by www.creative-technology.net

## Further Development
Because of our university moving online due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, we were not able fabricate this device. 
This documentation may be used to continue the project.
Future steps may include:
* Further case design and 3D printing
* Development and testing of skeleton code 
* Database development (sample liquids)
* Holistic device testing and liquid sampling
